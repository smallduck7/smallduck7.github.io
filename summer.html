	<p><b>Etymology and Ancient Beliefs</b></p>
<ul>
<li class="p">The term “summer” comes from the Old English word sumor, which originated from the Proto Indo-European root sam, meaning “together or one.”</li>
<li>Ancient pagans believed that celebrating summer with a bonfire increased the sun’s power, thus helping the crops grow.</li>
<li>A number of ancient civilizations including the Greeks, Romans, and Chinese celebrated the coming of summer in association with their gods and goddesses. For instance, Cronus, the Greek god of agriculture, Vesta or Hestia, the Roman goddess of the hearth, and Yin, the Chinese force honoring femininity.</li>
<li>During the Summer Solstice, early Native Americans, such as those of the Great Plains, held ritual dances to honor the sun.</li>
<li>Traditionally, Sun Dances were performed by young warriors to honor the Great Spirit and to test their stamina.
<li>Specifically, the Sioux people practiced the Sun Dance with participants representing the cosmos through colors. Red symbolizes sunset, blue for sky, yellow representing lighting, and black for night.</li>
<li>In European pagan traditions, picking flowers such as roses, verbena, St. John’s wort, and rue on the Summer Solstice would mean something special.</li>
<li>Some Christians celebrate the birth of John the Baptist during the Summer Solstice.</li>
</ul>
	<p><b>The Summer Season</b></p>
<ul>
<li>Summer in the Northern Hemisphere begins on June 21 and ends on September 23.</li>
<li>When it’s summer in the Northern Hemisphere, it’s winter in the Southern Hemisphere, and vice versa.</li>
<li>Summer occurs because of the way the Earth is tilted towards the sun. The hemisphere tilted towards the sun experiences summer and the hemisphere tilted away experiences winter.</li>
<li>Summer is the whole months of December, January and February in the Southern Hemisphere and the whole months of June, July and August in the Northern Hemisphere.</li>
<li>It’s the time of year that people enjoy spending outdoors. Most children have a long vacation from school in the summer. In older times, it was so they could help on the farm.</li>
<li>Tropical cyclones known as hurricanes start to form this time of the year. Hurricanes have wind speeds of over 120 km/h and can cause loss of life and property. They form in the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans.</li>
<li>Plants typically grow best in the summer months when they receive the most sunlight. Most animals are active in the summer, rearing young, and some, like the squirrel, begin to gather nuts for the winter.</li>
<li>In the United States, the Fourth of July and Labour Day are celebrated during the summer months.</li>
<li>Over 37,000 people visit Stonehenge during the Summer Solstice. Among the earliest people who celebrate the longest day of the year at the site were the Druids and Pagans.</li>
<li>The month of June came from the Roman goddess Juno, wife of Jupiter, while the month of July was named by Marc Anthony in honor of Julius Caesar. August was named after Julius Caesar’s adopted nephew who gained the title Augustus.</li>
<li>In 1896, the first Summer Olympics was held in Athens, Greece. It was officially known as the Games of the Olympiad. The games were housed in the first giant stadium of the modern times, Panathinaiko Stadium.</li>
<li>During summer, the Eiffel Tower in Paris, France, grows about 6 inches due to heat the expanding iron.</li>
<li>The dates from July 3 until August 11 were labeled as “dog days of summer”, after Sirius, the Dog Star, located in the constellation of Canis Major.</li>
<li>In the 1870s, one of the summertime staple activities was born. Frisbees were originally invented as pie plates when college students started throwing them around.</li>
<li>In 1905, ice pops were accidentally invented by an 11-year-old boy from San Francisco.</li>
