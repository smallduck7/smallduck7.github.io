	<p><img src="s1.jpg" class="s1">Two strangers, who awaken in a room with no recollection of how they got there, soon discover they're pawns in a deadly game perpetrated by a notorious serial killer.</p>
	
	<p><img src="s2.jpg" class="s2">Detective Eric Matthews, along with fellow police officers and a SWAT Team, locate Jigsaw's lair and go to arrest him, but discover that his easy arrest is only a part of Jigsaw's plan. Matthews soon learns that eight people are trapped in an old house and are playing Jigsaw's game. One of them is his own son, Daniel Matthews. Matthews learns that if he wants to see his son again, he must play one of Jigsaw's games as well. </p>
	
	<p><img src="s3.jpg" class="s3">Jeff is an anguished man who grieves and misses his son that was killed by a drunk driver in a car accident. He has become obsessed for revenge against the drunk driver, judge, and only witness who refused to testify; he has also become neglectful of his daughter. Lynn Denlon is a skilled surgeon that is cheating on her husband and suffering from depression. Both are abducted and brought to Jigsaw's warehouse, where they must play two separate games: Jeff must choose whether to save or let the people he holds responsible for the death of his son die, while Lynn must keep Jigsaw alive until Jeff completes his tests, or face the deadly consequences</p>
	
	<p><img src="s4.jpg" class="s4">Jigsaw and his apprentice Amanda are dead. Now, upon the news of Detective Kerry's murder, two seasoned FBI profilers, Agent Strahm and Agent Perez, arrive in the terrified community to assist the veteran Detective Hoffman in sifting through Jigsaw's latest grisly remains and piecing together the puzzle. However, when SWAT Commander Rigg is abducted and thrust into a game, the last officer untouched by Jigsaw has but ninety minutes to overcome a series of demented traps and save an old friend or face the deadly consequences.</p>
	
	<p><img src="s5.jpg" class="s5">Detective Mark Hoffman is deemed a hero after he saves a young girl and "escapes" one of Jigsaw's games, or so it seems. Special Agent Peter Strahm is suspicious of him after his assistant Agent Lindsay Perez says Hoffman's name. While Agent Strahm looks into Detective Hoffman's past, a group of five people who helped burn down a building which was supposedly abandoned face a series of tests set up by Jigsaw.</p>
	
	<p><img src="s6.jpg" class="s6">Special Agent Strahm is dead, and Detective Hoffman has emerged as the unchallenged successor to Jigsaw's legacy. However, when the FBI draws closer to Hoffman, he is forced to set a game into motion, and Jigsaw's grand scheme is finally understood.</p>
	
	<p><img src="s7.jpg" class="s7">As a deadly battle rages over Jigsaw's brutal legacy, a group of Jigsaw survivors gathers to seek the support of self-help guru and fellow survivor Bobby Dagen, a man whose own dark secrets unleash a new wave of terror.</p>
	
	<p><img src="s8.jpg" class="s8">Bodies are turning up around the city, each having met a uniquely gruesome demise. As the investigation proceeds, evidence points to one suspect: John Kramer, the man known as Jigsaw, who has been dead for over 10 years.</p>
