	<h1><a href="https://theoatmeal.com/">The Oatmeal (a good one):</a></h1>
 <p>Let me first say that the coding really took me for an intitial spin as it opens to a comment of a pterodactyl with a very funny joke. Moving on, I do not think that the coding is super modern. The coding mostly utilizes div and is somewhat clean. I am able to recognize most of what is coded, but they defnielty appear to be missing many of the elements that we have been taught in-class. They also do not use any tables within their code. The layout does makes sense to me for the most part. In addition, most of the website is laid out in a horizontal 3 column system. There is not a scrolling effect that I can see. Continuing, the layout of the website is fairly easy to navigate around. The navigation is pretty basic and makes it hard for someone to get lost while exploring the site. The only aspect of this website that could be deemed confusing is when you click to go to the shop which takes people to a sister-website meant just for buying things. Once you are on the sister-website there is no direct link back to the main site. This site utilizes mostly white background with black text. It does also utilize a touch of rainbow. I think that the color scheme definitely matches the audience intended for the website. The purpose of the site is to offer a campy environment with quirky comics and quirky merchandise. I think that the coloring works effectively to maintain focus on the funny images and cute comics. The hints of color offered by the rainbow aspects add a fun flare to the website and prevent it from being too boring. While I do think that the website relies a little heavily on their white space, I think that it is mostly utlized in an effective way. I also cannot help but completely love the little rainbow monster that is put at the bottom of the page, this is a nice little touch. I also like the touch of adding "pplease don't steal" to their copyright line in a means to protect the attwork of the site. A last little touch that sticks out is the little man, who almost seems like a mascot, used in the top left side of the page. This mascot is quite unique and sticks in your mind alond with the rainbows, making a memorable mark.</p>
 
	<h2><a href="http://amazon.com/">Amazon (another good one):</a></h2>
 <p>I am pretty sure that amazon is one of the most visited websites that exists on the internet today, and as such I thought it would be interesting to break it down a bit and look at the negatives and positives. Unsurprisingly the code is absolutely insane and very long, containing a multitude of things that I have never seen before. To my fairly untrained eye, the code does not appear to be all that clean as there are huge blocks of code, but I could be wrong. This website is the only websitee I reviewed that contains any HTML5 elements, and thus I would consider it to be fairly modern. This site actually does utilize tables which I think works in their favor. One of the other newer elements that I noticed in the coding was header, but again this sites code mostly utilized div with various class or id's. I think that the overall layout is decent but can seem a little crowded at times. However, given the nature of the website I think that this can be more readily accepted. The layout has a nice navigation that I think is very simple for the consumer to understand. The bottom of the page contains a multitude of additional resources that can help a customer find what they are looking for. The body is a variety of columns that are well formatted, keeping product images in a proper place. Overall I like the layout of this website the best as it has the most to offer a consumer and does a good job at balancing between having too much and just enough. I do not have much to say about the navigation because it is one of the better ones. I think that one can navigate around this website fairly well. I think that it is overall well done and not all that confusing. The site offeres multiple navigations that cover most everything that a person would be looking for and increase the ease of access. This website mostly utilizes a blue color scheme. The header navigation bar and footer are a nice darker blues and the text is done in white. The rest of the body mostly has a white background and uses black text. I think that this was done well and a good choice, it makes the website seem clean and crisp and does not avert attention from the sites main purpose. I think that the color choice is faily neutral and as such can appeal to a wide audience of individuals, which does seem to be the aim of this website. Overall good color scheme and don't really see any areas that need improvement on this front. I think that this website is set apart by the professional nature of the set-up. It all seems well made and looks as though a lot of thought and time was put into the creation of this site. The website does a good job of utlizing its white space, there is not too much spacing or too little. The text fits the website well and the sizing throughout it highly appropriate depending on the location. Lastly, I think that the website can be set about by its use of multiple navigations. Overall good site, understable why people like it.</p>
 
	<h3><a href="http://cloud9walkers.com/">Tennessee Walking Horses (not so good):</a></h3>
 <p>I believe that the coding for this website is fairly simple and clean. I can look at it and recognize what they were doing and what it means. I would not say that the code is particularly modern and does not contain any HTML5 elements that I could see. They do not use any code as fancy as tables, as the code mostly consits of the basic div and p. This code exemplifies the simpistic nature of the entire website design and I think could be improved by incorporating some newer elements. For example as opposed to using div with an id of "header", they could simply use the header element. The layout is probably the part of this website that I detest the most. Everything is basically located on one extremely long page that is broken up by a thin boarder line. There are no columns and definitely no scrolling effect. Most sections contain an image on the left and text on the right, while there are others with photos floating at random intervals in the block. I do not like how everything is separated and think that the website could improve by having multiple pages attached to a main page as opposed to the current set-up. I do not think that there is really all that much to say about the navigation of this website. At first glance, the navigation appears to be quite simple, and is. The reader simply scrolls through the main page, there is not a navigation head and so everything is located on one long continuous page. This website really only utilizes three main colors: white, blue, and black. The text is all set out in the standard black color and the entire background for the site is the image of clouds. I think that the chosen background image can be relatively distracting from the rest of the elements of the site. This being said, I do believe that the site is more aimed towards a younger audience, as many of the photos contain kids on horses, so with that I think the website would be inviting to children. Unfortunately I do not think that the chosen text formatting for this website really does anything to set it apart. They have chosen a very basic text font and color. I suppose that one could argue that this website is set apart by its use of photos, there is exceptional amount of photos that can pull the audeince in. In addition, the site also utilizes multiple tiny graphics/gifs throughout the webpage that I have not seen on other websites. I think that the website could eliminate some of these graphics, as it can be a little overkill, but I suppose someone might find them cute. Unfortunaly they are not of the highest quality, which is quite noticible, and detracts from the overall effect. Overall, I would have to say that I am not a particular fan of this website.
